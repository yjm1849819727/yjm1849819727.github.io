<br>Photography is not just a technique or an art form, but also a lifestyle. It allows me to pay more attention to the details in life, to cherish every moment even more, and it also provides a way to express myself and share stories. Through photography, I can love life more passionately and explore and experience this colorful world more actively.

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Painting

I can draw the world in my imagination with the pen in my hand, just as scientific research can gradually create its own world, and photography can record the world.

## Past Hobbies

In my freshman year, I also had a keen interest in gaming and even became involved with the motion capture laboratory at our university to contribute to game development. Regrettably, the application of motion capture technology was not focused on gaming but rather directed towards other fields, which ultimately led me to make the decision to discontinue my involvement.
